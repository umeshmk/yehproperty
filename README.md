<!-- ## Issues

#### Github pages

**Github Pages does NOT allow SPAs - Single page applications**. This is why a direct access to url like [https://umeshmk.github.io/yehproperty/project/7/kalpataru-paramount](https://umeshmk.github.io/yehproperty/project/7/kalpataru-paramount) will not work and return `404`. But it will works correctly on node server.

**This is not an issue to be solved since it's based on server configuration of Github Pages - a static server.**

#### Google Maps

Google Maps markers on hover shows `infowindow`. But the `html` for this `infowindow` does not support react components.

Any link inside `infowindow` can't use `<Link to="">` from React router.This force us to use `<a>` instead and results in Github Pages issue above.

_It's not an issue but a limitation._

Error `For development purposes only` is due to no billing account on Google cloud. -->
